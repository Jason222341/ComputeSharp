    Directory.Build.targets is automatically picked up and imported by
    Microsoft.Common.targets. This file needs to exist, even if empty so that
    files in the parent directory tree, with the same name, are not imported
    instead. The import fairly late and most other props/targets will have been
    imported beforehand. We also don't need to add ourselves to
    MSBuildAllProjects, as that is done by the file that imports us.

  <!--
    For all WinAppSDK projects (both published, test and sample projects, that's why this property group is
    defined here), we need to set the 'EnableMsixTooling' property. This does two main things: for XAML projects,
    it enables the embedded resources.pri file generation, and it also enables building with 'dotnet msbuild'.
    Without this property being set, Desktop MSBuild would be required to build all WinAppSDK projects.
    This property must be set in a .targets file, or 'TargetFramework' might be null when evaluated.

    Manually set the version if null. This is copied from Microsoft.NET.DefaultAssemblyInfo.targets and is needed
    for cases where that target is not being automatically imported (which happens because MSBuild is used instead
    of dotnet build for some cases, due to the solution having some WinUI 3 projects). The lines setting the prefix
    have been omitted, as that is already handled in the root .props file.
