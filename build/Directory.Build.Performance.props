  <!--
    Additional global options for all projects targeting Windows in their TFMs.
    We actually set these in a .props file and without checking the framework, as:
      - Setting these properties in non-Windows projects will just not do anything.
      - Setting these from the shared .targets causes them to be imported too late.
        They'd need to be added to "CustomBeforeMicrosoftCommonTargets" file, but the
        complexity of having to set that up and validate it is just not worth it, as
        we can just unconditionally set these and worst case, they'll be no-ops.

      Enable the CsWinRT trim/AOT analyzer for scenarios involving all types (including built-in types).
      The .NET SDK sets this to '1' (which excludes built-in types) by default to reduce false positives.

      We're only referencing CsWinRT for the source generators, we don't need to read any WinRT metadata.
      CsWinRT is in projection mode by default, so we want to disable it (or it'd need the Windows SDK).
